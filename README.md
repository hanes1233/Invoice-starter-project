# Invoice starter project 

## Description 

REST application to work with invoices

## How to use

SPA application with two database tables - invoice and persons. Back-End part made with Spring-Boot,
Front-End with React. Tables have 1:N relationship(one person to many invoices).
Each invoice must have seller and buyer(as person entities). Person could have none/one/many invoices.
Application support all CRUD operations on both tables, so we can create, read, delete and update(in case with person we just hide it
according to Accounting Act of Czech Republic), also we can display invoice's or person's statistics and filter/limit our results.
